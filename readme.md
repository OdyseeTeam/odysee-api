# API Server for LBRY on the Web

This project is the API server used by lbry.tv. If you are looking for the UI code, that lives here: https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop.

Active development is in progress, expect failing tests and breaking changes.

## Running with Docker

This is the recommended method for frontend development.

Make sure you have recent enough Docker and `docker-compose` installed.

**1. Initialize and launch the containers**

This will pull and launch lbrynet and postgres images, which lbrytv requires to operate.

`docker-compose up app`

*Note: if you're running a LBRY desktop app or lbrynet instance, you will have to either shut it down or change ports*

**2. Setup up the database schema if this is your first launch**

`docker-compose run app ./lbrytv db_migrate_up`

**3. Clone [lbry-desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/) repo, if you don't have it**

```
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:lbryio/lbry-desktop.git
```

**4. Launch UI in lbry-desktop repo folder**

```
SDK_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy yarn dev:web
```

**5. Open http://localhost:8081/ in Chrome**

## Running off the source (if you want to modify things)

You still might want to use `docker` and `docker-compose` for running SDK and DB containers.

**1. Launch the containers**

`docker-compose up -d postgres lbrynet`

*Note: if you're running a LBRY desktop app or lbrynet instance, you will have to either shut it down or change ports*

**2. Setup up the database schema if this is your first launch**

`go run . db_migrate_up`

**3. Start lbrytv API server**

`go run .`

**4. Clone [lbry-desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/) repo, if you don't have it**

```
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:lbryio/lbry-desktop.git
```

**5. Launch UI in lbry-desktop repo folder**

```
SDK_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 yarn dev:web
```

**6. Open http://localhost:8081/ in Chrome**

## Testing

Make sure you have `lbrynet` and `postgres` containers running and run `make test`.

## Modifying and building a Docker image

First, make sure you have Go 1.11+

- Ubuntu: https://launchpad.net/~longsleep/+archive/ubuntu/golang-backports or https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu
- OSX: `brew install go`

Then build the binary, create a docker image locally and run off it:

```
make image && docker-compose up app
```
